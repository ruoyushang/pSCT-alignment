/** @brief Class implementing the UaObject interface for the FolderType.
 *
 * OPC UA Objects are used to represent systems, system components, real-world objects and software
 * objects. They have the NodeClass @ref L3UaNodeClassObject. The detailed description of Objects and their attributes
 * can be found in the general description of the @ref L3UaNodeClassObject node class.
 *
 *  Instances of this Type are used to organise the AddressSpace into a hierarchy
 *  of Nodes.
 *
 *  They represent the root Node of a subtree, and have no other semantics
 *  associated with them. However, the DisplayName of an instance of the
 *  FolderType, such as “ObjectTypes”, should imply the semantics associated with
 *  the use of it. There are no References specified for this ObjectType.
 *
 *  See also \ref Doc_OpcUa_FolderType for a documentation of the complete Information Model.
