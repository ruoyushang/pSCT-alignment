 @brief  Interface definition of the MethodManager used for calling methods in the server.

 The MethodManager interface provides the method call capability for objects. The MethodManager
 interface is asynchronous. For the MethodManager callback the MethodManagerCallback interface is implemented by the consumer
 of the call results. One of the consumers is the UA Module. This interface is used by the SDK to multiplex the list of calls in
 the UA service to different MethodManagers.
