/** @brief Class implementing the UaObject interface for the AcknowledgeableConditionType.
 *
 * OPC UA Objects are used to represent systems, system components, real-world objects and software
 * objects. They have the NodeClass @ref L3UaNodeClassObject. The detailed description of Objects and their attributes
 * can be found in the general description of the @ref L3UaNodeClassObject node class.
 *
 *  **Variable members of the AcknowledgeableConditionType:**

 *  Browse Name    | DataType      | TypeDefinition       | Modelling Rule | See Also

 *
 *  Extends the ConditionType by defining acknowledgement characteristics. It is an
 *  abstract type.
 *
 *  The AcknowledgeableConditionType inherits all Properties of the ConditionType.
 *
 *  AcknowledgeableConditions expose states to indicate whether a Condition has to
 *  be acknowledged or confirmed.
 *
 *  The Confirmed Acknowledge model is typically used to differentiate between
 *  acknowledging the presence of a Condition and having done something to address
 *  the Condition. For example an Operator receiving a motor high temperature
 *  Notification calls the Acknowledge Method to inform the Server that the high
 *  temperature has been observed. The Operator then takes some action such as
 *  lowering the load on the motor in order to reduce the temperature. The Operator
 *  then calls the Confirm Method to inform the Server that a corrective action has
 *  been taken.
 *
 *  AckedState when FALSE indicates that the Condition instance requires
 *  acknowledgement for the reported Condition state. When the Condition instance
 *  is acknowledged the AckedState is set to TRUE. ConfirmedState indicates whether
 *  it requires confirmation. The two states are substates of the TRUE
 *  EnabledState. The EventId used in the Event Notification is considered the
 *  identifier of this state and has to be used when calling the Methods for
 *  acknowledgement or confirmation.
 *
 *  A Server may require that previous states be acknowledged. If the
 *  acknowledgement of a previous state is still open and a new state also requires
 *  acknowledgement, the Server shall create a branch of the Condition instance. In
 *  situations where state changes occur in short succession there can be multiple
 *  unacknowledged states and the Server has to maintain ConditionBranches for all
 *  previous unacknowledged states. These branches will be deleted after they have
 *  been acknowledged or if they reached their final state. Clients are expected to
 *  keep track of all ConditionBranches where AckedState is FALSE to allow
 *  acknowledgement of those. See also \ref OpcUa::ConditionTypeData
 *  "ConditionTypeData" for more information about ConditionBranches and the
 *  examples in Annex B.1 of Part 9 of the OPC UA Specification. The handling of
 *  the AckedState and branches also applies to the ConfirmState.
 *
 *  See also \ref Doc_OpcUa_AcknowledgeableConditionType for a documentation of the complete Information Model.
