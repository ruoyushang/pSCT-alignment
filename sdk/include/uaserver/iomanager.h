/** @ingroup ServerCoreInterfaces
 Interface definition of the IOManager used for reading, writing and monitoring data.
 The IOManager interface provides the reading, writing and monitoring capabilities for node attributes. The IOManager
 interface is asynchronous. For the IOManager callback the IOManagerCallback interface is implemented by the consumer of the
 attribute data. One of the consumers is the UA Module. This interface is used by the SDK to multiplex the list of nodes in
 the UA service call to different IOManagers. One UA service call is a transaction for the SDK. If an IOManager is used in a
 transaction, the beginTransaction method is called by the SDK. This allows the IOManager to create a context for the transactions
 since the SDK will call the associated begin method (e.g. beginRead for the UA Read service) for each node in the transaction.
 Depending on the underlying system, the action can be started for each node in the begin method or for a list of nodes in the
 finishTransaction method. If the underlying system allows optimizing access for a list of nodes, the finishTransaction method
 should be used to start the access to the underlying system. This method is called by the SDK after calling the begin methods
 for all nodes in the transaction.
