/** @ingroup ServerCoreInterfaces
 Interface definition of the HistoryManager used for reading, updating and deletion of data and event history.
 The HistoryManager interface provides the reading, updating and deletion capabilities for data and event history. The HistoryManager
 interface is asynchronous. For the HistoryManager callback the HistoryManagerCallback interface is implemented by the consumer of the
 history data or events. One of the consumers is the UA Module. This interface is used by the SDK to multiplex the list of nodes in
 the UA service call to different HistoryManagers. One UA service call is a transaction for the SDK. If an HistoryManager is used in a
 transaction, the beginHistoryTransaction method is called by the SDK. This allows the HistoryManagers to create a context for the transactions
 since the SDK will call the associated begin method (e.g. beginReadRawModified) for each node in the transaction.
 Depending on the underlying system, the action can be started for each node in the begin method or for a list of nodes in the
 finishHistoryTransaction method. If the underlying system allows optimizing access for a list of nodes, the finishHistoryTransaction method
 should be used to start the access to the underlying system. This method is called by the SDK after calling the begin methods
 for all nodes in the transaction.<br>
