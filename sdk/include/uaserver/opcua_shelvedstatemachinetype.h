/** @brief Class implementing the UaObject interface for the ShelvedStateMachineType.
 *
 * OPC UA Objects are used to represent systems, system components, real-world objects and software
 * objects. They have the NodeClass @ref L3UaNodeClassObject. The detailed description of Objects and their attributes
 * can be found in the general description of the @ref L3UaNodeClassObject node class.

 *
 *  Defines a substate machine that represents an advanced Alarm filtering model.
 *
 *  The state model supports two types of Shelving: OneShotShelving and
 *  TimedShelving.<!-- They are illustrated in Figure 13. --> The illustration
 *  includes the allowed transitions between the various substates. Shelving is an
 *  Operator initiated activity.
 *
 *  In OneShotShelving, a user requests that an Alarm be Shelved for its current
 *  Active state. This type of Shelving is typically used when an Alarm is
 *  continually occurring on a boundary (i.e. a Condition is jumping between High
 *  Alarm and HighHigh Alarm, always in the Active state). The One Shot Shelving
 *  will automatically clear when an Alarm returns to an inactive state. Another
 *  use for this type of Shelving is for a plant area that is shut down i.e. a long
 *  running Alarm such as a low level Alarm for a tank that is not in use. When the
 *  tank starts operation again the Shelving state will automatically clear.
 *
 *  In TimedShelving, a user specifies that an Alarm be shelved for a fixed time
 *  period. This type of Shelving is quite often used to block nuisance Alarms. For
 *  example, an Alarm that occurs more than ten times in a minute may get shelved
 *  for a few minutes.
 *
 *  In all states, the Unshelve can be called to cause a transition to the Unshelve
 *  state; this includes Un-shelving an Alarm that is in the TimedShelve state
 *  before the time has expired and the OneShotShelve state without a transition to
 *  an inactive state.
 *
 *  <!-- All but two transitions are caused by Method calls as illustrated in
 *  Figure 13. -->The “Time Expired” transition is simply a system generated
 *  transition that occurs when the time value defined as part of the “Timed
 *  Shelved Call” has expired. The “Any Transition Occurs” transition is also a
 *  system generated transition; this transition is generated when the Condition
 *  goes to an inactive state.
 *
 *  The ShelvedStateMachine includes a hierarchy of substates. It supports all
 *  transitions between Unshelved, OneShotShelved and TimedShelved.
 *
 *  This FiniteStateMachine supports three Active states; Unshelved, TimedShelved
 *  and OneShotShelved. It also supports six transitions.<!-- The states and
 *  transitions are described in Table 32.--> This FiniteStateMachine also supports
 *  three Methods: \ref OpcUa::ShelvedStateMachineType::TimedShelve "TimedShelve",
 *  \ref OpcUa::ShelvedStateMachineType::OneShotShelve "OneShotShelve" and \ref
 *  OpcUa::ShelvedStateMachineType::Unshelve "Unshelve".
 *
 *  See also \ref Doc_OpcUa_ShelvedStateMachineType for a documentation of the complete Information Model.
