/** @ingroup ServerCoreInterfaces
 Interface definition of the EventManager used for monitoring events.
 The EventManager interface provides the monitoring capabilities for object notifiers. The EventManager
 interface is asynchronous. For the EventManager callback the EventManagerCallback interface is implemented by the consumer of the
 events. One of the consumers is the UA Module. This interface is used by the SDK to multiplex the list of event monitored items in
 the UA service call to different EventManager. One UA service call is a transaction for the SDK. If an EventManager is used in a
 transaction, the beginEventTransaction method is called by the SDK. This allows the EventManager to create a context for the transactions
 since the SDK will call the associated begin method (e.g. beginStartMonitoring) for each monitored item in the transaction.
 Depending on the underlying system, the action can be started for each monitored item in the begin method or for a list of monitored items in the
 finishEventTransaction method. If the underlying system allows optimizing access for a list of monitored items, the finishEventTransaction method
 should be used to start the access to the underlying system. This method is called by the SDK after calling the begin methods
 for all monitored items in the transaction.
