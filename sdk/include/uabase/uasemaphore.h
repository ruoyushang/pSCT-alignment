/** @ingroup CppBaseLibraryClass
 *  @brief Semaphore class is used to allow threads to synchronize access to a resource.
 *  The UaSemaphore class provides a general counting semaphore.
 *  A semaphore is a generalization of a mutex.
 *  While a mutex can only be locked once, it's possible to acquire a semaphore multiple times.
 *  Semaphores are typically used to protect a certain number of identical resources.
 *  A typical application of semaphores is for controlling access to a circular buffer shared by a producer thread and a consumer thread.
 *  It is not possible to create shallow copies of this Class.
 *  It is not possible to use the default constructor.
