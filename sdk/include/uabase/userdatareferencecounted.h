/** @brief Base class for reference counted user data stored in reference counted objects like UaStructureDefinition.

 Reference counted user data classes need to be derived from this class if the user data should be added to SDK
 managed objects like a UaStructureDefinition to allow the SDK managed object to clean the memory of the user
 data when the SDK managed object is deleted.
