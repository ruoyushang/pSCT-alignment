/** @ingroup CppBaseLibraryClass
 *  @brief The UaMutex class provides access serialization between threads.
 *  The purpose of a UaMutex is to protect an object, data structure or section of code so that only one thread
 *  can access it at a time (this is similar to the Java synchronized keyword).
 *  It is usually best to use a mutex with a UaMutexLocker since this makes it easy to ensure that
 *  locking and unlocking are performed consistently.
 *  It is not possible to create shallow copies of this Class.

/** UaMutexLocker
 *  @brief Auto lock and unlock class for Mutex class.
 *  The UaMutexLocker class is a convenience class that simplifies locking and unlocking of a mutex.
 *  Locking and unlocking an UaMutex in complex functions and statements or in exception handling code is error-prone
 *  and difficult to debug. UaMutexLocker can be used in such situations to ensure that the state of the mutex is always well-defined.
 *  UaMutexLocker should be created within a function where an UaMutex needs to be locked.
 *  The mutex is locked when UaMutexLocker is created.
 *  You can unlock the mutex with unlock().
 *  If locked, the mutex will be unlocked when the UaMutexLocker is destroyed.
 *  It is not possible to create shallow copies of this Class.
