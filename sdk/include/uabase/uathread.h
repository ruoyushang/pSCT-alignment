/** @ingroup CppBaseLibraryClass
 *  @brief Platform independent class for a worker thread.
 *
 *  A UaThreads represents a separate thread of control within the program;
 *  it shares data with all the other threads within the process but executes independently
 *  in the way that a separate program does on a multitasking operating system.
 *  Instead of starting in main(), UaThreads begin executing in run().
 *
 *  A class representing a worker thread or a class that needs a background processing thread
 *  must be derived from UaThread and the method
 *  run() must be implemented as main function for the thread in this class. See the following
 *  sample code for the definition of such a class and the use of the class.
 *
 * @code
 * class MyWorkerThread : public UaThread
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyWorkerThread(){}
 *     virtual ~MyWorkerThread(){}
 *
 *     void run()
 *     {
 *         // Do something here
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * // Use worker thread
 * MyWorkerThread myThread;
 * // Start worker thread
 * myThread.start();
 *
 * // Wait for completion
 * myThread.wait();
 * @endcode
 *
 *  The class is also used by the UaThreadPool. If you have recurring task you want to execute
 *  in worker threads it is more efficient to use UaThread
 *
 *  It is not possible to create shallow copies of this Class.
