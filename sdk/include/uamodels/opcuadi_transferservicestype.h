    /** Method used to get the results of transfer from and to device methods
     *
     * The TransferTo- and TransferFromDevice Methods execute asynchronously after sending a response to the Client. Excution status and
     * execution results are collected during execution and can be retrieved using the FetchTransferResultData Method. The TransferId is
     * used as identifier to retrieve the data.
     *
     * The Client is assumed to fetch the result data in a timely manner. However, because of the asynchronous execution and the possibility
     * of data loss due to transmission errors to the Client, the Server shall wait some time (some minutes) before deleting data that have
     * not been acknowledged. This should be even beyond Session termination; i.e. Clients that have to re-establish a Session after an error
     * may try to retrieve missing result data.
     *
     * Result data will be deleted with each new Transfer request for the same Device.
     *
     * FetchTransferResultData is used to request the execution status and a set of result data. If called before the transfer is finished
     * it will return only partial data. The amount of data returned may be further limited if it would be too large. “Too large” in this
     * context means that the Server is not able to return a larger response or that the number of results to return exceeds the maximum number
     * of results that was specified by the Client when calling this Method.
     *
     * Each result returned to the Client is assigned a sequence number. The Client acknowledges that it received the result by passing the
     * sequence number in the new call to this Method. The Server can delete the acknowledged result and will return the next result set with
     * a new sequence number.
     *
     * Clients shall not call the Method before the previous one returned. If it returns with an error (e.g. Bad_Timeout), the Client can call
     * the FetchTransferResultData with a sequence number 0. In this case the Server will resend the last result set.
     *
     * The Server will return Bad_NothingToDo in the Method-specific StatusCode of the Call Service if the transfer is finished and no further result data are available.
