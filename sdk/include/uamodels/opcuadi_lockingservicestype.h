/** Callback interface used to implement the LockingServices interface in the user application
 *
 * Locking is the means to avoid concurrent modifications to a Device or Network and their components. Clients shall
 * use the locking services if they need to make a set of changes (for example, several write operations and Method
 * invocations) and where a consistent state is available only after all of these changes have been performed. The main
 * purpose of locking a Device is avoiding concurrent modifications. The main purpose of locking a Network is avoiding
 * concurrent topology changes.
 *
 * A Lock from one Client usually allows other Clients to view (navigate / read) the locked element. Servers may choose
 * to implement an exclusive locking where other Clients have no access at all (e.g. in cases where even read operations
 * require certain settings in a Device).
 *
 * When locking a Device, the lock applies to the complete device (including all components like blocks or modules).
 *
 * When locking a Modular Device, the lock applies to the complete Device (including all modules). Equally, when locking
 * a block-oriented Device (see 9.2), the lock applies to the complete Device (including all Blocks). Servers may allow
 * independent locking of Sub-Devices or Blocks, respectively, if no lock is applied to the top-level Device
 * (for Modular Device or for Block Device).
 *
 * If the Online / Offline model is supported, the lock always applies to both the online and the offline version.
 *
 * When locking a Network, the lock applies to the Network and all connected Devices. If any of the connected Devices
 * provides access to a sub-ordinate Network (like a gateway), the sub-ordinate Network and its connected Devices are
 * locked as well.
