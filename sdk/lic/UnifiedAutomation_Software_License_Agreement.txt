1. Grant of License
1.1 Evaluation License
If you downloaded a trial or evaluation version of the Software from Unified Automation's website or obtained it through other means, you may install and use one copy of the Software on a single computer of your organization, solely for evaluation and testing purposes during the evaluation period (typically three (3) month from first installation/use). You may not use the Software for commercial purposes. You may not make accessible the Software to third parties and you must make sure that no one except your authorized employees have access to the computer where the Software is installed. The Software may contain a disabling mechanism that will prevent it from being used after the evaluation period. You must not tamper with the disabling mechanism or the Software. After the evaluation period, if you do not order the registered version of the Software, you must remove/destroy the Software and Documentation without delay.
1.2 Runtime License
If you purchased runtime licenses you are permitted to use the Software according to the number of purchased licenses. For each license you are permitted to install and use one copy of the Software on a single computer, you might deploy or install the Software together with your end-user products or stand alone.
1.3 Binary Developer License
A binary developer license grants the use of the Software for the purpose of software development of OPC enabled products or applications. If you have purchased a binary developer license the Software may be used within your organization by a single developer to actively develop applications. Multiple copies of the Software may exist on more than one computer, as long as the use of the Software is by the same developer. In addition, you are permitted to deploy the application making use of the Software. The Software might be used by being compiled into, linked or bind to your application. All use of the Software shall be solely in accordance with the documentation. 
You are not allowed to resell, rent, lease or sublicense an unmodified or modified version of this Software as stand-alone product, nor to build toolkit or developer tools from it. You are permitted to use the software to build, deploy, sell and distribute end-user products. Licensee must comply with all of the following:
a. Licensee is permitted to distribute and/or make available the applications that are making use of the Software only in conjunction with and as an integral part of your application, and distribute and/or make available the binary files only as an integral part of your end-user application. Third party components and respective redistributables thereof, if any, are licensed to Licensee "as is". You must comply with their respective licenses.
b. Licensee's software product(s) are neither an UA Server development tool nor a Client development tool; licensee may not use the Software in such a way that results in development of product(s) that expose directly or indirectly similar functionality like the licensed Software itself (e.g. you may distribute libraries of the Software together with your application but not the corresponding, separate header files)
c. Licensee's applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the licensed Software; applications may not pass on functionality which in a simple way makes it possible for others to create software with the licensed Software (e.g. building products by simplifying Software's interface version or by wrapping for platform/language adoption is prohibited) 
d. Licensee shall indemnify and hold Unified Automation, its affiliates, contractors, and its suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of applications to the extent such claim or liability is not based on a defect or intellectual property infringement of the licensed Software itself.
e. Licensee may not use Unified Automation's name, logo or trademark to market your application without explicit written agreement with Unified Automation
f. Licensee must include a valid copyright notice on his software products
1.4 Source Code Developer License

===============================================================================
2. Use Definition
2.1 Authorization of Usage
Licensee acknowledges that Unified Automation is the sole owner of all rights in the Software and in all of the know-how pertaining to this Software except those described in Appendix A. It shall forbear to attack the rights of Unified Automation, unless Unified Automation asserts such rights against Licensee or Licensee attacks a patent or patent application (or similar, patent-related rights such as utility models) of Unified Automation. It will adequately inform third parties of Unified Automation's ownership of those rights.

Licensee shall only be granted a limited right of usage to the extent to which it is absolutely necessary for the purposes of this agreement. The provisions following hereunder are characterizations of this principle and shall be narrowly construed in cases of doubt. Unified Automation's copyright of the Software shall not be exhausted by this agreement. Nothing in this provision shall be construed in a way as to prevent Licensee from defending its rights in case Unified Automation infringes Licensee patents, trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriates Licensee's trade secrets.

For the developer license granted under Section 1.3 and/ or 1.4 above, the authorization of use encloses the "active development", which is the intellectual process of writing code that uses the Software, including but not limited to programming against the Software's interfaces and compiling and/or linking the Software's libraries. E.g. an automated buildbot would compile the Software, but would not use it in the scope of "active development" and hence does not require a developer license.

The Software may not be leased, assigned, or sublicensed, in whole or in part if and to the extent not expressly permitted in Section 1 ("Grant of License") above. You may not make accessible the Software to third parties and you must make sure that no one except your authorized Licensee has access to the computer(s) where the Software is installed. 
2.2 Temporary Transfer of Use Authorization
On written request by Licensee and upon prior authorization by Unified Automation, Licensee may temporarily transfer the developer license granted under Section 1.3 and/ or 1.4 above to another developer or to a subcontractor. Licensee's request must indicate the name, email address and full company postal address of the new developer and the reason for the requested transfer. Only temporarily and for a particular contracted development project, for the development of a component or product of the licensee, the licensee is allowed to give external participant - of this particular development project - access to the software. The licensee must insure that the external development partner is following all rules of the SLA and that the development partner is not using the software for any other purpose than this particular development project with the licensee. The rights of the recent developer to use the Software cease upon Unified Automation's consent to the transfer. Unified Automation remains the right to refuse such transfer for good cause. The written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, i.e. transferring to a direct competitor of Unified Automation causes reasonable refuse. 
2.3 Scope of Usage
The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole purpose of distribution to other computers is not "in use".
===============================================================================
3. Restrictions
Software is confidential copyrighted information of Unified Automation and title to all copies is retained by Unified Automation and/or its licensors. Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise reverse engineer Software. Software is not designed or intended for use in critical safety systems including but not limited to nuclear facilities, aircraft communication and aircraft control systems or other situations in which case of failure of the Software could lead to death or personal injury. 

Without limitation to any other terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Unified Automation and its suppliers and Unified Automation's and its suppliers respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from against any damages, fines, penalties, assessments, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) in the event that any claim is brought against any Indemnified Party arising from your use of the Software in critical safety systems including but not limited to nuclear facilities, aircraft communication and aircraft control systems or other situations in which case of failure of the Software could lead to death or personal injury.
===============================================================================
4. Trademarks and Logos
This Agreement does not authorize Licensee to use any Unified Automation name, trademark or logo.
===============================================================================
5. Warranty Limitation
General Warranties: Unified Automation represents and warrants that:  (a) it has the unqualified right to grant the licenses granted in this Agreement;  (b) it has not granted any conflicting rights, and no third party contractual duty will be breached by entering into this Agreement;  (c) the Software (expressly excluding all Third Party components as listed in Appendix A) does not infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of any third party;  (d) it will comply with, and conducts its operations according to, applicable laws, rules, codes, regulations, ordinances, and similar governmental directives of Germany and the European Union.  (e) the Software (expressly excluding all Third Party components as listed in Appendix A) does not require a license for export, and if any export license is required following the effective date, Unified Automation will notify Licensee promptly in writing;  (f) the Software does not contain any harmful code;  (g) Software will not be infected with a virus when it is shipped to Licensee.

The parties agree that it is not possible to develop software thus that it meets all the requirements of the application without error. Unified Automation shall make available a user documentation explaining the intended use and the using conditions of the Software, which shall always be kept up to date.

Only defects in the Software that occur within one (1) year after the download or delivery shall be remedied by Unified Automation according to the statutory provisions. Claims for damages shall be expressly excluded from this time limitation. For all damage claims, the statutory limitation period shall apply.

In the event of critical failures (Class1 and Class2) reported by Licensee within the one (1) year warranty period, Unified Automation will eliminate these failures at the request of Licensee without undue delay provided that these failures have been shown to result from failures in the Software delivered by Unified Automation (exclusive Third Party Software according to Appendix A). For this, Licensee will enable Unified Automation to access the project showing the corresponding failure, especially via a remote access or the making available of projects, which can be used in the development environment of Unified Automation in order to clearly reproduce the corresponding failure.
The parties agree that Class1 failures include the following cases:
- serious defects, massive functional limitations especially in the final product at customer installations, e.g. system crash, hang-ups, data corruption
The parties agree that Class2 failures include the following cases:
- defects, functional limitations in assured functionality that could not be bypassed or avoided, e.g. by means of auxiliary functions, as well as uncontrolled memory and/or resource consumption, which will cause functional limitations in the long term
Failures which, irrespective of their classification, are a result of incorrect use and/or use outside the conditions recommended by Unified Automation (as described in the documentation and the example code) will be eliminated by Unified Automation upon written request of Licensee and compensated using the common Unified Automation cost rates.
===============================================================================
6. Limitation of Liability
The Software and components are not intended to replace the professional skills and judgment of Licensee and its employees, agents and consultants. Licensee alone shall be responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of information and data furnished for processing and any use made by Licensee of the output of the Software or any reliance thereon. 
Unified Automation shall be liable towards Licensee to the fullest extent according to the statutory provisions.
a. in the event of damages caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence according of Unified Automation, its representatives or employees;
b. in case of damages resulting in death or personal injury;
c. to the extent that Unified Automation have expressly given a guarantee or accepted to bear a procurement risk;
d. in the event of liability under the German Product Liability Act ("Produkthaftungsgesetz").

Beyond a) to d) above, Unified Automation shall only be liable to Licensee in the event of damages caused by a negligent breach of a material contractual obligation. Unified Automation's liability shall, however, in this case be limited to the typical, foreseeable damage. If possible by applicable law, Unified Automation's entire liability to Licensee and Licensee's exclusive remedy shall be, at Unified Automation's option, either (A) return of the price Licensee paid for the licensed Software, or (B) repair or replacement of the licensed Software.

All further liability shall be excluded. 

The Software or the use of the Software may be subject to regulatory provisions related to products used in the Health Care Industry. Prior to using the Software, it is Licensee's responsibility to ensure that Licensee's use of the Software will not violate any legal or regulatory provisions nor deviate from the conditions intended for the use of the Software as explained in the user documentation.
===============================================================================
7. Indemnification
You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Unified Automation grants the licenses to their Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Unified Automation that certain configuration of the Software or the use for a specific purpose does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Unified Automation disclaims any liability to you for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, you hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow you to use the Software for a certain purpose or specific use case, it is your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing or using the Software.

If notified promptly in writing of any action (and provided that Unified Automation has been promptly notified of all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Licensee based on a claim that the unaltered release of the Software infringes a third party patent or copyright, Unified Automation shall, upon request of Licensee, defend such action at its expense including attorneys' fees and expert fees and pay any costs or damages finally awarded in such action which are attributable to such claim, provided that Unified Automation shall have sole control of the defense of any such action and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise. United Automation shall not be obliged to defend such action if the infringement is based on a prior version of the Software, the infringement has been fixed in the current version and Unified Automation has offered a free-of-charge update to Licensee before the claim arose.

If a final injunction is obtained against Licensee of any of the Software by reason of infringement of a patent or copyright, or if in Unified Automation's opinion any of the Software supplied to Licensee hereunder is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of infringement of a patent or copyright, Unified Automation shall, at its option and expense, either procure for Licensee the right to continue using such Software or replace or modify the same so that it becomes non-infringing or, if neither of the above options is commercially reasonable, Unified Automation will grant Licensee a full refund for such Software and accept their return. All rights of Licensee under the license granted according to this Agreement shall cease upon the return of the Software.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Unified Automation shall not have any liability to Licensee under this Section if the infringement or claim is based upon the use of any of the Software in combination with other equipment or software which is not furnished by Unified Automation (if such claim would have been avoided in case the Software was not in such combination, including but not limited to the combination with Third-Party components listed in Appendix A), Software which have been modified or altered by Licensee if the Software would not infringe but for the modification or alteration or intellectual property rights owned by Licensee, the relevant Customer or any of their respective affiliate.

Nothing in the forgoing shall prevent the Licensee at its option and expense to defend itself against claims brought against his end user products that are based on or make use of the Software independent of a certain use case of such end user products or to procure the respective rights or to replace or modify the
Software so that it becomes non-infringing.
===============================================================================
8. Termination
The license shall be for a period commencing upon the date of initial download or delivery of the Software and continuing until such time this agreement is terminated in accordance with this agreement, but otherwise without limitation as to duration. 

Unified Automation shall have the right to terminate this agreement if Licensee fails to pay any required license fee(s) or otherwise fails to comply with the license terms and conditions described in Section 1. Unified Automation shall give written notice to Licensee of such fault, and if such fault has not been remedied within thirty (30) days after, the license granted hereunder shall terminate. Licensee's end user products that include or are based on the Software and were already sold to customers at the time of cancellation or termination are not affected by the termination. 

On termination Licensee loses the rights granted in section 1 and 2 and is not allowed to actively develop new products nor enhance existing products or otherwise make use of or install the Software. If requested, License will certify in writing as to the destruction or return of the Software and all copies in its possession.

Each party's right to terminate the agreement for due cause according to the statutory provisions remains unaffected.
===============================================================================
9. Publicity
In the event that licensee has obtained a developer license, runtime license or source code license, Unified Automation reserves the right to reference Licensee as one of Unified Automation's customers by mentioning Licensee's company name in documents such as, but not limited to, web pages of Unified Automation's website, emails originating from Unified Automation's employees, publicity brochures and fact sheets, unless explicitly stated otherwise by Licensee. In no event shall Unified Automation publish any other information about Licensee other than the single fact that Licensee is a customer of Unified Automation.
===============================================================================
10. Entire Agreement
This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Germany. This agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, or by the Uniform Commercial Code, the application of which are expressly excluded. If the Licensee is a businessperson and has general jurisdiction (legal domicile) within Germany, sole venue for all disputes arising directly or indirectly out of the contract shall be at the Defendant's place of business. If the Licensee has no general jurisdiction (legal domicile) within Germany, a court at Unified Automation's company location in Nuremberg, Germany is the exclusive local jurisdiction and venue for any disputes arising from this agreement.

This Agreement is the parties' entire agreement relating to the Software. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, warranties, and representations with respect to its subject matter, and following Licensee's acceptance of this license by clicking on the "Accept" Button or by installing and using the Software, will prevail over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or any other communications by or between the parties. No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
===============================================================================
11. Export Control
Licensee acknowledges that the licensed Software may be subject to export control restrictions of various countries. Licensee shall fully comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the importation of the licensed Software and/or modified Software and/or applications and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the licensed Software, modified Software or applications.
===============================================================================
12. No Implied License
There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Unified Automation and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the licensed Software and/ modified Software, as applicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Unified Automation under this Agreement.
===============================================================================
13. Surviving Sections
Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive a cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall also be deemed to survive. Such terms and conditions include, but are
not limited to the following Sections: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 2 shall not survive if the Agreement is terminated for material breach.

On termination the Licensee loses the rights granted in section 1 and 2 and is not allowed to actively develop new products nor enhance existing products. Exception: Section 2 shall survive for the purpose minimal required for continuing sales of present end user products of the Licensee that include or are based on the Software, and for the purpose of support and bug fix of these products that were already sold to customers at the time of cancellation or termination.
===============================================================================
14. Severability
If any of the above provisions are held to be in violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived or amended to the extent necessary for the Agreement to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction. However, if in Unified Automation's opinion deletion or amendment of any provisions of the Agreement by operation of this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the liabilities of Unified Automation or its licensors, Unified Automation reserves the right to terminate the Agreement.
===============================================================================
Appendix A and B are part of the License Agreement and must be followed by the licensee.

5.1.3 License in Short
The JAVA Stack stays under the Reciprocal Community License (RCL) which is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness. 

The RCL is adapted from the Open Source Reciprocal Public License (RPL) where the "Public" in the Open Source RPL license is replaced by the "Community" in the RCL License. In short, the RPL license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a "third party". While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base. 

While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RCL is found in two definitions: "Deploy" and "Required Components". 
- Regarding deployment, under the RCL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the community when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software. 
- Further, under the RCL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.
